Our College Scheduler Application has 4 main features, that correspond to the 4 user cases that the assignment prompted.

First of all, we have a main screen with 4 buttons, which are mapped each to one user feature. This serves as the home page and where all the screens will return to after the activity is done.

For the first user story, it is mentioned that: "As a college student I want to add, edit, and delete class details in the app, so that I can keep my class schedule up-to-date and organized.". Therefore we have created the Courses button, which redirects the app to the courses screen. In there, we can see that there is a big purple button in which we can add new courses. The courses will have these fields as inputs:
* Course ID
* Course Name
* Time
* Instructor

As courses are being added, tap in each one of them to:
* See more details about the course
* Edit information in them
* Delete them

With all these features, it is now possible for students to keep their schedule in the application and have a convinient and easy way to access it instead of having to remember it or write it down in a piece of paper.

For the second user story, they've said that: "As a college student I want to manage my assignments through the app, so that I can track due dates and my progress for each assignment.". The Assignments button covers this need. If pressed, you will be prompted to the Assignments screen that will be really similar to the courses screen. The main difference is that now there is an option to sort the Assignments either by due date or by course name. Assignments take the following inputs:
* Title
* Due Date
* Class
* Description

Users are still able to view, edit and delete assignments as they like.

With this new option, students now can keep track of all their assignments and sort them by date so that they know how to prioritize and allocate their time for their tasks.

Regarding third user story: "As a college student I want to input and keep track of my exam dates and details, so that I can prepare effectively for my exams". The Exams button will redirect to the exam's screen, which prompts for the following fields when registering a new exam:
* Exam name
* Date
* Class
* Location

Users will be able to view, edit and delete exams in this screen. With this users can now keep track of exams and prepare accordingly, not forgetting any.

For the last user story ("As a college student I want to create and manage to-do lists for my academic tasks, so that I can organize and prioritize my work.") we have the last button, "To-do List". We are able to put notes inside the list of activities that the user may want to do during the day. You will only be asked to put a description of the task when adding a new entry, and you are able to edit and delete these to-do's as well.

Here is a video showcasing all features that have been mentioned so far:
