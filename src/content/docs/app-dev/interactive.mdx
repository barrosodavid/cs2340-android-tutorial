- ✅ How to set and get property values of a view from code.

# Auto imports

In Java, every time you want to use a function from a different file, you need to import it. This can be a bit annoying, but Android Studio has a feature that can help you with that called **Auto Imports**.

It is enabled by default, but if you don't have it enabled, you can find it and enable it in the top right corner.

# Show a toast

In this step, you will attach a Java method to the Toast button to show a toast when the user presses it. A toast is a short message that appears at the bottom of the screen for a short period of time.

1. Open `FirstFragment.java` in app > java > com.example.cs2340_android_tutorial > FirstFragment.

2. This class has only two methods, `onCreateView` and `onViewCreated`. These execute when the fragment is created, one after the other. Check the following code to the `onViewCreated` method:

If you want to deep more into the difference between `onCreateView` and `onViewCreated`, you can check [this article](https://medium.com/@abdulqadirtr/deep-dive-into-fragments-when-to-use-oncreate-oncreateview-and-onviewcreated-33faf6454955).

```java
binding.randomButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                NavHostFragment.findNavController(FirstFragment.this)
                        .navigate(R.id.action_FirstFragment_to_SecondFragment);
            }
        });
```

This code is setting a click listener to the button with the ID `random_button`. When the user clicks the button, the app navigates to the `SecondFragment`.

3. Now add the following code after the previous one to set a click listener to the Toast button, and show a toast when the user clicks it:

```java
binding.toast_button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
   @Override
   public void onClick(View view) {
       Toast myToast = Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Hello toast!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
       myToast.show();
   }
});
```

4. Run the app and press the **Toast** button. You should see a toast at the bottom of the screen.

# Make the Count button update the TextView

In this step, you will attach a Java method to the Count button to update the TextView when the user presses it, making it show a counter that increases by one every time the button is pressed.

1. In `fragment_first.xml`, make sure that the `id` for the `TextView` is `textview_first`. If it's not, change it to that.

2. In `FirstFragment.java`, add the following code to the `onViewCreated` method:

```java
binding.countButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
   @Override
   public void onClick(View view) {
       TextView myTextView = binding.textviewFirst;
       int currentCount = Integer.parseInt(myTextView.getText().toString());
       myTextView.setText(String.valueOf(currentCount + 1));
   }
});
```

It might look a bit confusing at first, but it's actually quite simple if we go step-by-step. This code is setting a click listener to the button with the ID `count_button`. 
When the user clicks the button, the app gets the current value of the `TextView`, which has a text or `string` type in Java.
    
Then, it converts the text to an `integer` number, adds 1 to it, and sets the new value of the `TextView` to the new number.

3. Run the app and press the **Count** button. You should see the number in the `TextView` increase by one every time you press the button.
